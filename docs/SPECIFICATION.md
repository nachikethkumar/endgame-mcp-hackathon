# Model Context Protocol Specification

## Protocol Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to facilitate the seamless interaction between a client application and server-side tools, primarily focused on using APIs for data retrieval and analysis. MCP ensures that tools are built in a standardized, efficient way to handle requests, process data, and provide responses within an asynchronous, non-blocking framework. It allows the integration of multiple components (like web scraping, data analysis, etc.) to work in sync, ensuring that the system is both scalable and easy to maintain.

MCP is implemented using the **FastMCP** framework, which streamlines the communication between tools, processes, and external services (such as APIs). The architecture enables robust and highly responsive interactions with external APIs, such as the MASA API for scraping crypto news, while ensuring flexibility for future additions of services and tools.

## Core Components

1. **Client-Server Communication**:
   - The client communicates with the server by making HTTP requests, querying the server for specific data.
   - The server responds with the processed data from external services (e.g., the MASA API).

2. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Asynchronous communication ensures that the system can handle multiple requests at once without blocking. This is achieved using `aiohttp` for making non-blocking HTTP requests to external APIs.

3. **MCP Tools**:
   - The tools are defined using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator, allowing the server to define various operations (such as scraping data from websites or querying APIs) that can be triggered based on user requests.
   - Tools are modular and can be reused across various components of the server.

4. **MASA API Integration**:
   - The server integrates with the MASA API for real-time web scraping, fetching cryptocurrency news, and other data points. It interacts with MASA's endpoints for search and analysis, while managing API keys securely via environment variables.

5. **Data Processing**:
   - Data retrieved via the tools (e.g., news articles) is parsed, formatted, and returned in an appropriate structure for client consumption.
   - The protocol ensures data is returned in a standardized format, typically in JSON, for easy handling by clients.

## Interfaces

1. **Client Interface**:
   - The client sends requests to the server with parameters specifying the data needed (e.g., a cryptocurrency name for news scraping).
   - The client receives a structured response from the server, containing the relevant data (e.g., latest crypto news articles).

2. **Server Interface**:
   - The server exposes various tools via MCP that are designed to handle specific requests, such as searching for tweets or scraping news articles.
   - The server processes requests asynchronously, interacts with external APIs (e.g., MASA), and returns the processed data.

3. **Tool Interface**:
   - Tools are defined using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator and can be triggered by the client. Each tool will perform specific actions (e.g., query news, perform analysis) and return the appropriate results.

4. **MASA API Interface**:
   - The server interfaces with the MASA API via a set of standardized HTTP requests (GET and POST) to perform actions like scraping news and analyzing content. The server handles the API's response and processes the data for use by clients.

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**:
   - The client initiates a request, providing a query parameter (e.g., cryptocurrency name) for which the server should fetch data.
   
2. **Server Tool Activation**:
   - The server identifies which MCP tool is relevant to process the clientâ€™s request (e.g., a tool for fetching crypto news).
   - The server triggers the appropriate tool to interact with the MASA API or any other necessary service.

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - The activated tool fetches data from the external service (e.g., MASA API) asynchronously. 
   - The tool sends a request to the external service (like the MASA API) and awaits the response.

4. **Data Processing**:
   - Once the data is fetched, the server processes it by parsing and formatting the response from the external service.
   - The server may also handle errors or timeouts, ensuring the client receives appropriate feedback if there are issues.

5. **Client Response**:
   - The server returns the processed data to the client. The response may be in JSON format, containing the requested data (e.g., a list of news articles, tweets, or analysis).

## Context Management

The MCP handles context by maintaining the state of tools during interaction. Each tool can access the context of the current request and return the results based on the previous tool's output or query.

- **Temporary Context**: During a single session or request, tools can share and pass data between them. For instance, after fetching the latest news, the context can be passed to a subsequent tool that performs sentiment analysis on the data.
  
- **Persistent Context**: In cases where tools interact with persistent data (e.g., saving news or analysis results for later use), the context is stored across requests and can be accessed as needed.

- **Error Handling**: Context management also ensures that error states are captured and handled gracefully. If a tool encounters an issue, it can send appropriate error messages back to the client.

## Integration Guidelines

1. **Adding New Tools**:
   - To integrate a new tool, use the `@mcp.tool()` decorator to define the tool's functionality.
   - Ensure the tool's function is asynchronous to maintain non-blocking execution.
   - Define a clear input/output interface for the tool, and ensure it interacts properly with external APIs or data sources.

2. **Interfacing with External APIs**:
   - Ensure that the server properly handles API keys and sensitive data using environment variables.
   - Implement error handling for API calls, including timeouts, invalid responses, and rate limiting.

3. **Communication with Clients**:
   - Ensure the client-server communication is clear and follows the JSON response format for consistency.
   - Provide proper documentation for clients to understand how to use the system and interact with the server (e.g., how to format requests, what data will be returned).

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Since tools interact with external services, consider caching frequently requested data to minimize redundant calls to external APIs.
   - Use asynchronous techniques throughout the system to maximize concurrency and avoid blocking operations.

5. **Security**:
   - Secure the API key management and ensure it is not exposed to the client-side.
   - Implement necessary rate limiting and error handling to avoid misuse or excessive API calls to external services.
